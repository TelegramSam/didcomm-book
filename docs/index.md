# Overview
DIDComm is an open protocol for decentralized communication. It uses DIDs ([Decentralized Identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)) to establish confidential, ongoing connections, without the need for usernames and passwords. You can then layer on existing services and applications on top of DIDComm to take advantage of DIDComm's security and privacy.

DIDComm empowers end users with privacy-focused solutions by default, while still retaining flexibility and ease of implementation for developers.

## For decision makers
With DIDComm, you keep your options open. It can work alongside OpenID4VC. It enables features you’re likely to need, such as trustable, ongoing connections—if not now, then in the future.
- Deliver on privacy promises: connections are established without the need to “phone home”, and the connections are direct and encrypted without involving a middleman.
- Use DIDComm connections for identity proofing, messaging, verifiable credential exchanges, and more.
- Choose from many flexible solutions for human-to-human or human-to-business interactions.

## For developers
DIDComm developer benefits include:

- Open standards protocol, continually improved by an active community.
- Fully decentralized with no central infrastructure or control.
- Transport independent: supports https, websockets, bluetooth, and more.
- Works well with related technologies, including blockchain, KERI, verifiable credentials, etc.

## Background
Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. DIDs can refer to any subject, such as a person, organization, thing, data model, and more.

DIDComm uses DIDs to bring the benefits of decentralization and confidentiality to many types of communication.

Other secure communication solutions already exist. However, most rely on centralized approaches such as server-based architectures with the requirements for hosted components. Many are only for unstructured chat, or enable features through proprietary extensions. They may also assume a single transport (e.g. https), making it difficult to use in a range of situations.

DIDComm fixes these problems. It delivers a foundation of security, privacy, and decentralization. It works over https, websockets, bluetooth, and other transports. Any DIDComm protocols you use, for messaging to verifiable credentials and more, automatically inherit these benefits.

Applications of DIDComm include online identities, creating and maintaining relationships, buying and selling, scheduling events, negotiating contracts, issuing licenses and permits, presenting tickets for travel, applying to employers or schools or banks, arranging healthcare, playing games, and voting.
