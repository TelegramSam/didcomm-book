# Overview
DIDComm is an open protocol for decentralized communication. You can use it to create
trustworthy relationships between people and businesses in a privacy-preserving way.

It uses DIDs ([Decentralized Identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)), to establish confidential, ongoing connections, without
the need for usernames and passwords. You can then layer on existing services and applications
on top of DIDComm to take advantage of DIDComm's security, privacy and decentralization.
